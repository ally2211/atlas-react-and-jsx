        Hi, I'm a Full-Stack specialization student currently
        in my fifth trimester at Atlas School. I enjoy working with JavaScript,
        React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. After school, I hope to contribute to
        impactful tech projectsâ€”especially those that serve non-profits,
        missionaries and exploring spiritual tech ideas.
      </p>
